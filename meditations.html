<span class="dropcap">B</span>ut how can I know there is not something different from those
things that I have just considered, of which one cannot have the
slightest doubt? Is there not some God, or some other being by
whatever name we call it, who puts these reflections into my mind?
That is not necessary, for is it not possible that I am capable of
producing them myself? I myself, am I not at least something? But I
have already denied that I had senses and body. Yet I hesitate, for what
follows from that? Am I so dependent on body and senses that I cannot
exist without these? But I was persuaded that there was nothing in all
the world, that there was no heaven, no earth, that there were no minds,
nor any bodies: was I not then likewise persuaded that I did not exist?
Not at all; of a surety I myself did exist since I persuaded myself of
something [or merely because I thought of something]. But there is
some deceiver or other, very powerful and very cunning, who ever
employs his ingenuity in deceiving me. Then without doubt I exist also
if he deceives me, and let him deceive me as much as he will, he can
never cause me to be nothing so long as I think that I am something. So
that after having reflected well and carefully examined all things, we
must come to the definite conclusion that this proposition: I am, I exist,
is necessarily true each time that I pronounce it, or that I mentally
conceive it.
